Get ready to flap like a pro with the most compact version of Flappy Bird  for the Commodore 64 (and also for Commodore Plus/4)! With only 256 bytes of pure fun, this mini-game will challenge your hand-eye coordination to the limit. So put on your retro gaming hat, avoid pipes, and see how far you can fly in this byte-sized adventure!

The C64 version was ranked 3rd in the Nano Game Oldschool at Lovebyte 2023.

# ABOUT THE SOURCE CODE

I believe that the source code is well documented. I used ACME to compile assembly code into machine code.
